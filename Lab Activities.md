## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly's AWS environment? Answer guidance: Comma separated without spaces, in alphabetical order. (Example: ajackson,mjones,tmiller) 

First I did a quick search and found out that the only index available was "botsv3"
```
index=* | stats count by index
```
Then I went to investigate where AWS stores logs for user access and got to: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-logging-and-monitoring.html, AWS CloudTrail made the most sense based on the descriptions: ..."captures all API calls for IAM and AWS STS as events, including calls from the console and API calls"...
```
index=botsv3 | stats count by sourcetype
```
Sourcetype "aws:cloudtrail" identified

The next step for me was to find out what exact data is stored in CludTrial:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | fieldsummary
```

Found "userIdentity.userName" which is the most aligned to what I was looking for to answer the question.
Finally enumerated the available user names:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | stats count by userIdentity.userName
```
üü¢ **Answer**: bstoll,btun,splunk_access,web_admin

## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì What field would you use to alert that AWS API activity have occurred without MFA (multi-factor authentication)? Answer guidance: Provide the full JSON path. (Example: iceCream.flavors.traditional)  

Online search took me to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html where I found:
```
...
"userIdentity": {
    "type": "AssumedRole",
    "principalId": "AROAIDPPEZS35WEXAMPLE:AssumedRoleSessionName",
    "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/RoleToBeAssumed/MySessionName",
    "accountId": "123456789012",
    "accessKeyId": "",
    "sessionContext": {
      "attributes": {
        "mfaAuthenticated": "false",
        "creationDate": "20131102T010628Z"
      },
      "sessionIssuer": {
        "type": "Role",
        "principalId": "AROAIDPPEZS35WEXAMPLE",
        "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleToBeAssumed",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "RoleToBeAssumed"
      }
    }
}
...
```
The following search then brings four events
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail 
| search userIdentity.sessionContext.mfaAuthenticated=false
```
üü¢ **Answer**: userIdentity.sessionContext.mfaAuthenticated

## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì What is the processor number used on the web servers? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation. (Example: The processor number for Intel Core i7-8650U is i7-8650U.)

Again had to check if there's any sourcetype that points to hardware-related logs
```
index=botsv3 | stats count by sourcetype
```
I found the sourcetype: "hardware" and its results all bring the same processor info
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=hardware
```
üü¢ **Answer**: E5-2676

## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì Bud accidentally makes an S3 bucket publicly accessible. What is the event ID of the API call that enabled public access? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation.

Did a quick search trying to find the account belonging to our guy "Bud", most probably "bstoll" or "btun"
```
index=botsv3 "bud"
```
Amongst the logs I found this:
```
 { [-]
   active: true
   alertCounts: { [+]
   }
   authType: LOCAL
   backupDeviceCount: 1
   backupUsage: [ [+]
   ]
   blocked: false
   computerCount: 1
   creationDate: 2018-08-19T13:39:48.231Z
   email: bstoll@froth.ly
   emailPromo: true
   firstName: Bud
   invited: false
   lastLoginDate: 2018-08-19T13:46:20.276Z
   lastName: Stoll
   licenses: [ [+]
   ]
   localAuthenticationOnly: false
   modificationDate: 2018-08-19T13:45:43.916Z
   modular_input_consumption_time: Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:22:39 +0000
   notes: null
   orgId: 1852
   orgName: Frothly
   orgType: ENTERPRISE
   orgUid: 858489735492421636
   passwordReset: false
   quotaInBytes: -1
   roles: [ [+]
   ]
   securityKeyType: AccountPassword
   shareDeviceCount: 0
   status: Active
   timestamp: Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:22:39 +0000
   userExtRef: null
   userId: 7211
   userUid: 858527737266971219
   username: bstoll@froth.ly
   usernameIsAnEmail: true
} 
```
So our guy was "bstoll" with accountId=622676721278 

The answer requires to identify a change made via API so the call should be "PUT".
After doing some googline I came across this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketPolicy.html that points to
```
PutBucketPolicy
```
I did not get any results using "PutBucketPolicy"
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail bstoll eventName=PutBucketPolicy
```
Then I found https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAcl.html 
 2 events found querying:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail bstoll eventName=PutBucketAcl
```
One of these events is granting WRITE and READ permissions to "global/All users"
```
 Grantee: { [-]
               URI: http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers
               xmlns:xsi: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
               xsi:type: Group
             }
             Permission: READ
           }
           { [-]
             Grantee: { [-]
               URI: http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers
               xmlns:xsi: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
               xsi:type: Group
             }
             Permission: WRITE
           }
```
That's the event we are looking for, we need its EventID

üü¢ **Answer**: ab45689d-69cd-41e7-8705-5350402cf7ac

## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì What is the name of the S3 bucket that was made publicly accessible?

Using the last query
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail bstoll eventName=PutBucketAcl
```
We need to expand the 'requestParameters' object to see this:
```
 requestParameters: { [-]
     AccessControlPolicy: { [+]
     }
     acl: [ [+]
     ]
     bucketName: frothlywebcode
   }
```
There we can identify the bucket name.

üü¢ **Answer**: frothlywebcode

## ‚ùìTASK‚ùì What is the name of the text file that was successfully uploaded into the S3 bucket while it was publicly accessible? Answer guidance: Provide just the file name and extension, not the full path. (Example: filename.docx instead of /mylogs/web/filename.docx)  

I can't see an event in CloudTrial that could be related to file uploads and listing by the events in the frothlywebcode bucket also does not gives any clues
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail  requestParameters.bucketName=frothlywebcode 
| stats count by eventName
```
I found (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events) that potentially data uploads to the bucket could be logged by 'AWS::S3' as per the service description:
> Amazon S3 object-level API activity (for example, GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject API operations) on buckets and objects in buckets.

Seems that the sourcetype could potentially be
```
aws:s3:accesslogs
```
Build a query to find all TXT-related events on the 'aws:s3:accesslogs' sourcetype:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:s3:accesslogs "*.txt"
```
Found 3 logs. Now I need to crosscheck the time when the bucket was publicly accessible (8/20/18 1:01:46.000 PM) to one of the listed events.
The 3 listed events match the time nefore the ACL was changed to remove public access.

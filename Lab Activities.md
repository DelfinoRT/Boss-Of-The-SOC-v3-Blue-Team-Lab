游릭TASK游릭 **List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly's AWS environment? Answer guidance: Comma separated without spaces, in alphabetical order. (Example: ajackson,mjones,tmiller)**  

First I did a quick search and found out that the only index available was "botsv3"
```
index=* | stats count by index
```
Then I went to investigate where AWS stores logs for user access and got to: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-logging-and-monitoring.html, AWS CloudTrail made the most sense based on the descriptions: ..."captures all API calls for IAM and AWS STS as events, including calls from the console and API calls"...
```
index=botsv3 | stats count by sourcetype
```
Sourcetype "aws:cloudtrail" identified

The next step for me was to find out what exact data is stored in CludTrial:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | fieldsummary
```

Found "userIdentity.userName" which is the most aligned to what I was looking for to answer the question.
Finally enumerated the available user names:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | stats count by userIdentity.userName
```
**Answer**: bstoll,btun,splunk_access,web_admin

游릭TASK游릭 **What field would you use to alert that AWS API activity have occurred without MFA (multi-factor authentication)? Answer guidance: Provide the full JSON path. (Example: iceCream.flavors.traditional)**  

Online search took me to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html where I found:
```
...
"userIdentity": {
    "type": "AssumedRole",
    "principalId": "AROAIDPPEZS35WEXAMPLE:AssumedRoleSessionName",
    "arn": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/RoleToBeAssumed/MySessionName",
    "accountId": "123456789012",
    "accessKeyId": "",
    "sessionContext": {
      "attributes": {
        "mfaAuthenticated": "false",
        "creationDate": "20131102T010628Z"
      },
      "sessionIssuer": {
        "type": "Role",
        "principalId": "AROAIDPPEZS35WEXAMPLE",
        "arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/RoleToBeAssumed",
        "accountId": "123456789012",
        "userName": "RoleToBeAssumed"
      }
    }
}
...
```
The following search then brings four events
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail 
| search userIdentity.sessionContext.mfaAuthenticated=false
```
**Answer**: userIdentity.sessionContext.mfaAuthenticated

游릭TASK游릭 **What is the processor number used on the web servers? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation. (Example: The processor number for Intel Core i7-8650U is i7-8650U.)**  

Again had to check if there's any sourcetype that points to hardware-related logs
```
index=botsv3 | stats count by sourcetype
```
I found the sourcetype: "hardware" and its results all bring the same processor info
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=hardware
```
**Answer**: E5-2676

游릭TASK游릭 **Bud accidentally makes an S3 bucket publicly accessible. What is the event ID of the API call that enabled public access? Answer guidance: Include any special characters/punctuation.**  

Did a quick search trying to find the account belonging to our guy "Bud", most probably "bstoll" or "btun"
```
index=botsv3 "bud"
```
Amongst the logs I found this:
```
 { [-]
   active: true
   alertCounts: { [+]
   }
   authType: LOCAL
   backupDeviceCount: 1
   backupUsage: [ [+]

} 
```
So our guy was "bstoll" with accountId=622676721278 

The answer requires to identify a change made via API so the call should be "PUT".
After doing some googline I came across this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketPolicy.html that points to
```
PutBucketPolicy
```
I did not get any results using "PutBucketPolicy"
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail bstoll eventName=PutBucketPolicy
```
Then I found https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketAcl.html 
 2 events found querying:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail bstoll eventName=PutBucketAcl
```
One of these events is granting WRITE and READ permissions to "All users"
```
 Grantee: { [-]
               URI: http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers
               xmlns:xsi: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
               xsi:type: Group
             }
             Permission: READ
           }
           { [-]
             Grantee: { [-]
               URI: http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers
               xmlns:xsi: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
               xsi:type: Group
             }
             Permission: WRITE
           }
```
That's the event we are looking for, we need its EventID

ðŸŸ¢ **List out the IAM users that accessed an AWS service (successfully or unsuccessfully) in Frothly's AWS environment? Answer guidance: Comma separated without spaces, in alphabetical order. (Example: ajackson,mjones,tmiller)**  

Firs I did a quick search and found out that the only index available was "botsv3"
```
index=* | stats count by index | fields index
```
Then I went to investigate where AWS stores logs for user access and got to: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-logging-and-monitoring.html, AWS CloudTrail made the most sense.
```
index=botsv3 | stats count by sourcetype
```
Sourcetype "aws:cloudtrail" identified
The next step for me was to find out what exact data is stored in CludTrial:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | fieldsummary
```
Found "userIdentity.userName" which is the most aligned to what I was looking for to answer the question.
Finally enumerated the available user names:
```
index=botsv3 sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail | stats count by userIdentity.userName
```
